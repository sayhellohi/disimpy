Disimpy is a simple tool for generating synthetic diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data that can be useful in model validation and method development. Data is generated by running massively parallelized Monte Carlo simulations on Nvidia's CUDA-capable graphical processing units. Please note that this module is not finished yet.
